# Custom-Chatbot-Project
## Udacity's course LLMs & Text Generation project

In this Chatbot project I will be collecting data from Wikipedia page of 2024. This dataset I have chosen is appropriate for this task since I have two question from events on 2024 and the model of gpt-35-turbo was updated till 2021.

We can provide context (RAG) to th model for obtening the response from 2024.

Question 1: Who was elected president of the United States of America? 
Question 2: When was X (former twitter) banned in Brasil?

### Step 0 - Initial OpenAI response¶
Before I custom a chatbot, I want to ask the openAI model 2 questions from 2024 to check its answers.

### STEP 01 - DATA INDEXING
